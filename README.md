What is Genetic Algorithms?
Genetic Algorithms (GAs) are adaptive heuristic search algorithm based on the evolutionary ideas of natural selection and genetics. As such they represent an intelligent exploitation of a random search used to solve optimization problems. Although randomised, GAs are by no means random, instead they exploit historical information to direct the search into the region of better performance within the search space. The basic techniques of the GAs are designed to simulate processes in natural systems necessary for evolution, specially those follow the principles first laid down by Charles Darwin of "survival of the fittest.". Since in nature, competition among individuals for scanty resources results in the fittest individuals dominating over the weaker ones.

Genetic Algorithms Overview
GAs simulate the survival of the fittest among individuals over consecutive generation for solving a problem. Each generation consists of a population of character strings that are analogous to the chromosome that we see in our DNA. Each individual represents a point in a search space and a possible solution. The individuals in the population are then made to go through a process of evolution.

GAs are based on an analogy with the genetic structure and behaviour of chromosomes within a population of individuals using the following foundations:

Individuals in a population compete for resources and mates.
Those individuals most successful in each 'competition' will produce more offspring than those individuals that perform poorly.
Genes from `good' individuals propagate throughout the population so that two good parents will sometimes produce offspring that are better than either parent.
Thus each successive generation will become more suited to their environment.
